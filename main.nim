   like the original bot, most of the cool-looking stuff are in the text commands, somehow
   make sure to:
   elif m.content == prefix & "command name":
   if you want a new command
   "elif" means elseif which means that if the "elif" or "if" before it are invalid then it will do X thing
   the "m.content" stands for message content, the "==" means equals
   "prefix & "command name":" uses the variable "prefix" which contains the prefix so if the user (for example) runs ">_about" then it
   will show the "about" command stuff! the two dots are the "then" (e.g.: if X thing true then | if X == true: )
   in a simplified way, it's essentially:
   "ok, if the content of the message is ">_command name" then do this:"
