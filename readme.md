# bigrat (the bot)
bigrat is a discord bot based on the website [bigrat.monster](https://bigrat.monster) which i saw when i was in the minecraft anarchy community (oo, lore!)

the bot used to be written in python and the old python code can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/releases) it may be outdated and i recommend checking the commits instead!

there's also this: https://github.com/bigratwtf/bigrat (which is a clone of this, but better and in python!)

>[!NOTE]
>i \*currently\* can't update this as i somehow fucked nix (or i simply don't know how to fix a c compiler thing) and can't compile stuff to test

the bot currently has these commands:
1. `ping` - the ping example in [Dimscord](https://github.com/krisppurg/dimscord)'s github page because i don't understand the documentation (yet..)
2. `about` - shows information about the bot
3. `help` - shows commands

the old bot used to have **these** commands:
1. `ping` - test bot latency
2. `kick` & `ban` - kick and ban
3. `dm` - DMs user mentioned (or id, idfr lmaoo)
4. `restart` - restarts the bot
5. `serverinfo` & `userinfo` - self-explanatory
6. `lock`
7. and others i forgot...
