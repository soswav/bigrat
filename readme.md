## bigrat
![](https://bigrat.monster/media/bigrat.jpg)
repo for the cool discord bot, "big rat" (based from the picture of [bigrat.monster](https://bigrat.monster)!) coded by `wascertified` & `soswav`!

the bot (currently) has around 20~ commands! (not a lot, but we're planning on adding more!)

the bot has a [wiki](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/wiki) for you to read (if you wanna selfhost) and should also be pretty easy to follow! (it has grammar though...)

we are also planning on moving the [OG bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1186799032899743835&permissions=8&scope=bot) to a hosting website, so watch out for that too!

found any issue in the code? open a [issue](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/issues)!
