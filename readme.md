## bigrat
![](https://bigrat.monster/media/bigrat.jpg)
repo for the cool discord bot, "big rat" (based from the picture of [bigrat.monster](https://bigrat.monster)!) coded by `wascertified` & `soswav`!

the bot (currently) has around 20~ commands, with a constant update shchedule because we are bored (i'm still learning python, silly wawa...)

the bot has a [wiki](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/wiki) for you to read (if you wanna selfhost) and should also be pretty easy to follow!

found any issue in the spagethtu cocde??! open a [issue](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/issues)!

NOTE FOR WAWA: teach me python you prick

if the owners of the bigrat.monster ever see this, please contact me like RN
the rat is the only thing in my head currently, if i see a rat or mice i just go "oh that reminds me of the picture of bigrat.monster"
i'm going insane.
