# Installers Folder

Basically, this folder is for saving the installer for whatever you're using. `Wawa` is the one that mantains the `.bat` file, while I maintain the `.sh` files.

Open an issue if the scripts don't work or you find an improvement, fix, or issue. Thanks in the future, I guess.

## Installing via linuxinstaller.sh

Run this on your terminal:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/releases/download/release/linuxinstaller.sh
chmod +x $HOME/linuxinstaller.sh
./linuxinstaller.sh
```

The command above will give the file permission to be run through your terminal.
