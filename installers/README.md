# Installers Folder

Basically, this folder is for saving the installer for whatever you're using. `Wawa` is the one that mantains the `.bat` files, while I mantain the `.sh` files.

Open an issue if the scripts don't work or you found an improvement/fix/issue. Thanks in the future, I guess.

## Installing via linuxinstaller.sh

First, go to where you downloaded the file then run:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/releases/download/release/linuxinstaller.sh
chmod +x $HOME/linuxinstaller.sh
./linuxinstaller.sh
```

The command above will give the file permission of being ran through your terminal.

**NOTE:** Please **read** as it will ask and do stuff that you **may not want.** *(You can view the file [here](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/blob/main/installers/linuxinstaller.sh).)*

If you have no clue of what you're doing whatsoever I personally recommend going to the [wiki](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/wiki).

**NOTE:** The wiki is currently outdated *(or simply unaccurate)* and may be moved to a `README.md` file.
